# Email Verification Application

## Overview
This application provides a robust email verification system to ensure secure user authentication and validation. The system allows users to register, receive a verification email, and confirm their email addresses before gaining full access to the application.

## Technologies Used
### **Backend**
- **Spring Boot** â€“ Used to develop the backend services, handling authentication, email verification, and user management.
- **GraphQL & RESTful API** â€“ Provides flexible data fetching and communication with the frontend.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** â€“ The backend is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalability and easy management.

### **Frontend**
- **Angular** â€“ A dynamic frontend framework used for the user interface and interactions.

### **Database**
- **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)** â€“ The system uses a relational database hosted on AWS RDS for efficient data storage and management.

## Features
- **User Registration** â€“ Users can sign up by providing their email and other required details.
- **Email Verification** â€“ An email is sent to the user with a verification link.
- **Secure Authentication** â€“ Users can log in only after verifying their email.
- **GraphQL & REST API** â€“ Supports both GraphQL and RESTful APIs for flexible client-side integration.
- **Scalable Deployment** â€“ Hosted on AWS services for reliability and performance.

## Deployment
- **Backend**: Deployed on AWS **Elastic Beanstalk**.
- **Database**: Managed on **AWS RDS**.
- **Frontend**: Built with **Angular** and communicates with the backend APIs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
